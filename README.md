# Slipstream_2.0

Evolution of Slipstream for testing new stacks.

The original Slipstream F1 Draft is a full stack Java web app project, built using Spring Boot, Spring Security,
Hibernate-JPA and Thymeleaf.
This version is intended to leverage different frameworks and stacks to improve functionality, and for practicing
integration of new technologies into an existing project.
