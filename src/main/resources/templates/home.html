        <h3>What is Slipstream F1 Draft Picks?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Slipstream is a fantasy sports game based on the real-world Formula 1 championship.</p>
          <p>It uses a draft pick format, so that no two players/teams in the same league can have the same driver.</p>
          <p>Most fantasy sports games are aimed at existing fans of the sport, so knowledge and frequent team
            management
            gives players an advantage.</p>
          <p>
            Slipstream introduces an element of luck to the game, so that those who know the sport better don't have too
            much advantage if luck is not on their side.
          </p>
          <p>
          <h4>How to play:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Register an account with your email address and choose a username, then log in.</li>
            <li>Go to your Dashboard, where you can name and create your team. Your team is automatically added to the
              current open league.
            </li>
            <li>When you join a league, you are randomly assigned a 1st and 2nd draft pick number.
            </li>
            <li>To make the game more
              fair, the better your 1st pick number is, the worse your 2nd will be. E.G. If you get the best 1st pick,
              you also get the worst 2nd pick.
            </li>
            <li>Each league has 10 teams, with 2 drivers per team. When a league is full, a new one is automatically
              created. The draft picks for each league cannot begin until the league is full.
            </li>
            <li>Once a league is full, players in that league take turns adding drivers to their teams, in order of
              their
              pick numbers. When all 20 drivers have been picked, the game begins!
            </li>
            <li>The league is now active, and teams will score whatever points their drivers get in the real life F1
              Driver's Championship.
            </li>
            <li>
              Points will only be gained from future races, so any points that drivers already have will not be added to
              your team.
            </li>
            <li>
              No new teams or leagues can be created after the start of Qualification, until the following Monday,
              during
              a F1 race weekend.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of the season, most points wins! If points are level, the team who had the worse first pick
              number wins.
            </li>
          </ol>
